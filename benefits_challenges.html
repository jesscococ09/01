                Telemedicine offers a wide range of advantages for both patients and healthcare
                 professionals, making care more accessible, efficient, and supportive. It allows 
                 people to receive medical attention from the comfort and privacy of their homes, 
                 reducing the need for travel, childcare arrangements, or time away from work, and 
                 often shortening wait times by fitting appointments into busy schedules. Studies 
                 show that telemedicine can significantly cut travel time, expenses, and lost work 
                 hours for families attending remote specialty visits. It also expands access to 
                 care for people in rural or underserved areas and can reduce barriers such as 
                 stigma or discrimination. Telemedicine is often more coste&#8209;ffective than in&#8209;person 
                 visits, with research showing substantial reductions in healthcare and travel 
                 costs across settings like ICUs, pediatrics, dermatology, and radiology. It 
                 supports family involvement by allowing caregivers to join virtual visits, and 
                 it helps prevent chronic disease complications by enabling timely preventive care, 
                 especially for conditions like cardiovascular disease. Telemedicine also 
                 reduces exposure to contagious illnesses by streamlining clinic workflows and 
                 minimizing time spent around others who may be sick. Finally, it allows 
                 clinicians&#8209;such as occupational and physical therapists&#8209;to observe patients in
                  their natural environments, leading to more accurate, contextualized assessments
                   of how they move, function, and interact with their surroundings.

                Telemedicine also comes with limitations that can affect both patients and providers. 
                Technical problems such as device glitches, poor connections, or low&#8209;quality cameras 
                can interfere with communication and make diagnosis more difficult. Because clinicians
                 cannot physically examine patients, some conditions are harder to assess remotely, and
                  this can weaken the sense of rapport or trust between patient and doctor. Access is 
                  another challenge, since not everyone has reliable high&#8209;speed internet or the necessary 
                  equipment to participate in virtual visits. Protecting electronic health records adds 
                  another layer of complexity, and questions about malpractice, liability, and reimbursement
                   remain inconsistent across insurers. Medicaid and private payers vary widely in what they 
                   cover, Medicare limits coverage to certain rural regions, and patients generally must meet
                    with practitioners licensed in the state where they are located during the appointment.
